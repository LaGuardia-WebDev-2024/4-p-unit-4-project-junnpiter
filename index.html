  <h1>Jun's Favorite Marvel Rivals Maps</h1>
  <p>and why! <br>
  ft. my beautiful main (and my stats), Luna Snow
<br><br>
Before I begin with my favorite maps, I can share some stats of mine. Scroll if you don't wanna read it, but you can if you're curious. I'll never know.<br>
Currently, I am a lord Luna Snow and Cloak & Dagger. I have Psylocke sitting at captain (almost centurion), but I'm a Bucky and Hela DPS main. For tank, I lock Emma Frost. I am not good at tank. Do not trust my tanking abilities. <br>
I average about 1,900 heals per minute and average about 18k healing per game. I once racked up 20k heals in a 5 minute match (super goated #BigAim) <br>
um that's it. I just really like Luna Snow. That's my girl. I need them to add Shang-Chi. Thanks. Also linked some of my clips below :) Do enjoy my rivals endeavors as a support main.</p>

<div id="hero-section" class="section blue-bg">
  <h1>TOKYO-2099 : SHIN-SHIBUYA</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Too beautiful of a map for it to not be here. I also get most of my wins on this map. I just love this map.<br>
  This map is my favorite because the design and the color palette is gorgeous. Tt's also just overall very safe for me as a Luna main because there's so many walls EVERYWHERE. <br>
  It's not like it's impossible to get dove in this map, but I always get decent teammates on this map.<br>
<br>
Here's some of my clips and some stats on this map :3</p>
  <br><br>

<div id="content-section" class="section green-bg">
    <h1>INTERGALACTIC EMPIRE OF WAKANDA : HALL OF DJALIA</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Such a beautiful map, but also I'm a little biased because I got over 50k healing in a competitive match on this map. Kinda goated I guess, but we didn't win... ggs<br>
    I also just really like how this map goes in general. Convergence on this map is so easy because flankers are so clear to see and it's so easy for dps to peel.<br>
  For peeling, does it happen all the time? No. But does it happen? Yes. #ILoveGoodDPSTeammates <br><BR>
  here's more clips and stats</p>
    <br><br>
</div>

<div id="final-section" class="section red-bg">
  <h1>HYDRA CHARTERIS BASE : HELL'S HEAVEN</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I love the backstory this provides for rivals Bucky. I remember reading it and getting viscerally upset. <br>
     I also love the scenery and whenever I play on this map, it feels like we always trap the enemy team in their spawn. It's the best. I love this map for that very reason. <br>
     Also, my ult takes up practically the entire point. It's beautiful.
  <br> <br>
For those who don't know, Bucky has special voicleines/interactions with Hawkeye on this map because Bucky had been captured by HYDRA and brainwashed into being the Winter Soldier. <br>
He ended up being saved by Hawkeye and a version of Captain America from the year 2099 from their brainwashing forces, which is why Hawkeye and Bucky have specific interactions on this map. <br>

  <h1>HONORABLE MENTION:
  K'UN-LUN : HEART OF HEAVEN</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>ok so i've actually played on this map total one time but i'm biased because lin lie is my favorite marvel character. i feel required to put this here. <br><br>
  since i haven't played on this map much, i'll lowk just lore drop a little bit... <br>
lin lie's home! yay yay! this is where the role of the iron fist was born. the dragon that you see in the back is named shou-lao the undying.</p>
