  <h1>Jun's Favorite Marvel Rivals Maps</h1>
  <p>and why! <br>
  ft. my beautiful main, Luna Snow</p>
  
  <h3>TOKYO-2099 : SHIN-SHIBUYA</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>too beautiful of a map for it to not be here. i also get most of my wins on this map. i just love this map.</p>
  <br><br>

  <h3>INTERGALACTIC EMPIRE OF WAKANDA : HALL OF DJALIA</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>such a beautiful map but also i'm a little biased because i got over 60k healing in a quick play on this map. kinda goated i guess but we didn't win... ggs</p>
  <br><br>

  <h3>HYDRA CHARTERIS BASE : HELL'S HEAVEN</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>i love the backstory this provides for rivals bucky. i remember reading it and getting viscerally upset. i also love the scenery and also whenever i play on this map, it feels like we always trap the enemy team in their spawn. it's the best. i love this map for that very reason. also, my ult takes up practically the entire point. it's beautiful.
